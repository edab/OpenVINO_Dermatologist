## Introduction

This project is part of the *Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree* course, and is based on the [2017 ISIC Challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a).  

All the data presented and objective are pulled from there.

The aim of this project is to design an algorithm that can visually diagnose [melanoma](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma), the deadliest form of skin cancer. The algorithm will distinguish this malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions ([nevi](http://missinglink.ucsf.edu/lm/dermatologyglossary/nevus.html) and [seborrheic keratoses](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/bumps-and-growths/seborrheic-keratoses)). 

As part of the challenge, participants were tasked to design an algorithm to diagnose skin lesion images as one of three different skin diseases (melanoma, nevus, or seborrheic keratosis).
